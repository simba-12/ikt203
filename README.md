# Data Structures and Algorithms - IKT203 Course Projects

## Overview
This repository contains various C++ implementations of data structures and algorithms developed for the IKT203 course. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific data structure or algorithm implementation.

## Project Structure
- **dobble-linked-list/**: Implementation of a doubly linked list used for a playlist management application
- **quick-sort/**: Implementation of the randomized QuickSort algorithm for efficient sorting
- **stack/**: Implementation of a mathematical expression evaluator using stack data structure

## Main Project - Playlist Manager
The main.cpp file in the root directory contains a doubly linked list implementation for a playlist management system. This application allows users to:
- Add songs with unique IDs, titles, and artist names
- Remove songs by their ID
- Display the playlist in both forward and reverse order
- Search for songs by ID

### Running the Main Project
1. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o playlist_manager main.cpp
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./playlist_manager
   ```

## Requirements
- C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Development Environment
This project was developed using:
- Visual Studio Code with C/C++ extension
- GCC compiler
- Debugging configuration is provided in the .vscode directory

## Author
These implementations were created as part of coursework for the IKT203 course.
